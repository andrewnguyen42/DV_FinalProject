#ETL

We sourced our data from Jeffrey Wooldridge's Econometrics dataset. During
the ETL process, we went through a two stage process. First, we had to
convert the original DTA file (originally for STATA consumption) into a CSV
using R's DTA reader. After we converted the DTA file into a CSV, we added
a school identifier to each record. Additionally, we split the dataset into
two tables: metrics and school information. We could have left our data
denormalized, but we chose to split the data in to two tables to practice
joining data in R and Tableau.
